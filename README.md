You can find the Serbian LLM eval dataset [on HuggingFace](TODO). For more details on how the dataset was built see [this technical report](TODO) TODO.

## IMPORTANT

* running this this will eat your google cloud credits or will bill you if you're already in the billing mode (this happens after you spend free credits and then deliberately enable billing again).

* you can use your free credits to translate 500.000 chars / month!

* if this is the first time you're creating a gcloud project you'll have 300$ of free credits!

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you meet the following requirements:

**For Linux Users:**

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/)

**For Windows Users:**
1. Windows Subsystem for Linux [(WSL2)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). If you don't have WSL2 installed, follow these steps in Windows cmd/powershell in administrator mode:

    ```bash
    wsl --install

   // Check version and distribution name.
   wsl -l -v

    // Set the newly downloaded linux distro as default.
    wsl --set-default <distribution name>
    ```
2. Install [Git](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-git) from the WSL terminal.

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install git
    git --version
    ```
3. Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/) from the WSL terminal.
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/miniconda3

    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh

    bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3

    rm -rf ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh

    // Initialize conda with bash.
    ~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash
    ```

4. Follow the instructions below on WSL.

## Instructions for translating lm harness eval from English into Slovenian

First let's setup a minimal Python program that makes sure you can run Google Translate on your local machine.

1. Create a Google Console project (https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Enable Google Translation API -> to enable it you have to setup the billing and input your credit card details (a note regarding safety: you'll have 300$ of free credit (if this is the first time you're doing it) and no one can spend money from your credit card unless all those free credits are spent and you re-enable the billing again! if you already had it setup in that case you have 500.000 chars/month for free!)
3. Install Google Cloud CLI (gsutil) on your machine (see this: https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install/)

    a.) Download the Linux archive file (find latest version from link above)

     `curl -O https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/downloads/google-cloud-cli-455.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`

    b.) Extract the contents from the archive file above.

    `tar -xf google-cloud-cli-455.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`

    c.) Run installation script. `./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh`

    d.) Initiate and authenticate your account. `./google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud init`

    e.) Create a credentials file with `gcloud auth application-default login`
4. Create and setting up the conda env

    a.) Open a terminal (if on Windows use the `WSL` terminal, if you're on Linux just use your terminal conda will already be in the PATH)

    b.) Run `conda create -n open_nllb python=3.10 -y`

    c.) Run `conda activate open_nllb`

    d.) Run  `pip install google-cloud-translate`

That's it! After that just create a `test.py` Python file with the following code and run with `Run and Debug` option in VS code after creating the launch.json file:

```Python
from google.cloud import translate

client = translate.TranslationServiceClient()
location = "global"
project_id="<your project id from above>"
parent = f"projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}"

response = client.translate_text(
    request={
        "parent": parent,
        "contents": ["How do you do? Translate this."],
        "mime_type": "text/plain",
        "source_language_code": "en-US",
        "target_language_code": "sl",
    }
)
value_translated = response.translations[0].translated_text
print(value_translated)
```
